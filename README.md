# Light Field Super-Resolution Network Using Joint Spatio-Angular and Epipolar Information
This repository contains official pytorch implementation of "Light Field Image Super-Resolution Network via Joint Spatio-Angular and Epipolar Information" submitted in IEEE Transactions on Computational Imaging 2022, by Vinh Van Duong, Thuc Nguyen Huu, Jonghoon Yim, and Byeungwoo Jeon.

## News
[To-do-list]: we would like to integrate our model to [BasicLFSR](https://github.com/ZhengyuLiang24/BasicLFSR), where many SOTA methods have been implemented in a unified framework

[2022-12-26]: we have updated the pre-trained models and codes.


## Results
We share the pre-trained models and the SR LF images generated by our HLFSR-C32 and HLFSR-C64 model on all the 5 datasets for 2x and 4x SR, which are avaliable at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SaTT3iP4GruKcome8r97Y6y54Nrj4gc5

## Code
### Dependencies
* Python 3.6
* Pyorch 1.3.1 + torchvision 0.4.2 + cuda 92
* Matlab

### Dataset
We use the processed data by [LF-DFnet](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=9286855), including EPFL, HCInew, HCIold, INRIA and STFgantry datasets for training and testing. Please download the dataset in the official repository of [LF-DFnet](https://github.com/YingqianWang/LF-DFnet).

### Prepare Training and Test Data
* To generate the training data, please first download the five datasets and run:
  ```matlab
  GenerateTrainingData_HLFSR.m
* To generate the test data, run:
  ```matlab
  GenerateDataForTest_HLFSR.m
### Train
* Run:
  ```python
  python train_HLFSR.py
### Test
* Run:
  ```python
  python test_HLFSR.py
### Visual Results
* To merge the Y, Cb, Cr channels, run:
  ```matlab
  GenerateResultImages.m
